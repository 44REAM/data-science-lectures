# Image Processing Course

This repository contains materials for the Image Processing course. This course covers fundamental concepts and advanced techniques in digital image processing.

## Course Topics

1.  **Geometric Transformation, Image Interpolation:**  Geometric transformations for image resizing, rotation, and warping.  Different image interpolation methods for resampling images.
2.  **Frequency Domain Filtering, 2D Fourier Transform, Sampling and Aliasing, Radon Transform:**  Introduction to frequency domain analysis of images using the 2D Fourier Transform.  Understanding sampling, aliasing, and the Radon transform.
3.  **Image Resampling and Registration:** Techniques for image resampling and registration, including feature-based and intensity-based registration methods.
4.  **Deep Generative Models and Self-Supervised Learning in Images I:** Introduction to deep generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) and self-supervised learning techniques for image generation and analysis.
5.  **Deep Generative Models and Self-Supervised Learning in Images II:** Further exploration of advanced deep generative models and self-supervised learning methods, including recent research and applications.
6.  **Diffusion Imaging:** Principles of diffusion imaging, including the diffusion tensor model, fiber tracking, and applications in neuroscience and clinical settings.
